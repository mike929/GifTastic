# GifTastic

<br>

This app uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice.  The page has some prepopulated buttons, however you can search and make your own.

1.  10 gifts will be returned from each button "topic".

2. The app takes the topics and adds them to the array as well as creates buttons in the HTML.
  
3. When you click on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

4. When you click one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. Click the gif again, it will stop playing.

5. Under every gif, the rating is displayed (PG, G, so on).
   * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
